I am happy to study frontend, I am fond of practice and I like to understand the topic deeply. I want to be part of a team that works together on a common goal. I prefer friendly and eco-friendly communication. I can quickly learn new technologies to use them. I calmly take criticism of my code, listening to the professional advice of more experienced colleagues.

**My skill:**
* HTML, CSS, JS, препроцессоры (sass, less), БЭМ
* ReactJS, Redux, Redux-Saga
* webpack, gulp
* Git
* I use VSCode, WebStorm

        this.postId = postId;
        this.dom = new DOM();
        this.ajax = new AsyncAjax();
    }
}
```
